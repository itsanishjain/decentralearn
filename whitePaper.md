# Web3.0 Leanrzy Concept 

## Introduction 

The business model of Web2.0 is aggregation of data contributed by billions of unpaid contributors, while retaining the economic benefits of the data within the shareholders.  
The internet has been a great leveler. It has democratized information and knowledge. Anyone can publish anything on the internet. Anyone can read anything on the internet.

The internet has also been a great leveler in terms of access to knowledge. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can access the same information. 

However, the internet has not been a great leveler in terms of access to knowledge.
The internet is a great place for creators. It allows them to share their work with the world and get paid for it.

But there are problems. The internet is a centralized place. This means that the big platforms that host content and make it available to the world have a lot of power.
They can decide who sees what content and how much they pay for it, change the rules of the game at any time, censor creators, steal from creators, ban creators, use creators content to make money without paying them. 

For example, why are the profits of Google not distributed back to the websites it crawled to get its data? Why does Quora or Stackoverflow not share its profits with the ‘best answer’ providers? Why does Wikipedia not pay its contributors? 

In simple words, Web2.0 giants rely on users doing good deeds, and then letting go of their economic benefits and ownership. This is why we have not witnessed very powerful online communities in Web2.0 - we have witnessed only ‘marginal’ contributions. 

In contrast to the above, we introduce a Web3.0 concept called Leanrzy. 
Leanrzy is an online platform, where creators own their resources, and earn rewards on them, while users can earn by learning. Leanrzy is open learning platform so the content will be free. Most of the content available on web2 will be imported to our platform in the early stages. The fairness of the rewards distribution is ensured via a smart contract on the blockchain. 

The future of knowledge is decentralized. We are building a decentralized knowledge network that allows creators to own their content. We are building a platform that will be the future of content creation and distribution
In other words, a Leanrzy is a Web3.0 community where good deeds are incentivized via rewards, including monetary rewards. All contributions are recorded on a public blockchain, and distributed automatically via a smart contract, and thus, it is software that ensures the fairness of the distribution of rewards. This enriches the environment, which self-propagates itself to greater volumes. 

At Leanrzy every work and resource is stored on decentralized storage as NFT, by this way the creators will exercise the full rights of their works. 


# Learnzy concept = Web3.0 Open Learning Platform with “Learn to earn” model. 

### Implementation Logic 
A practical implementation of the Web3.0 Learnzy concept focuses on answering the following questions details: 

-   1. What is the core metric / value proposition of a Learnzy? 
-   2. What actions are rewarded, and disrewarded?
-   3. How contributions are counted (consensus)? 
-   4. How contributions are rewarded (incentivization)? 




### Social Impact 
“A Learnzy is the new social graph where anyone can add value and get rewards fairly.” 
We firmly believe that a Learnzy provides a revolutionary opportunity for the masses, since it presents an equitable global marketplace for ‘non-marginal’ user contributions, and will be exceedingly helpful to various sections of society which Web2.0 marginalised. Non-marginal contributions mean that contributors can think of doing part-time work and get a reliable sustenance, which is controlled by the overall society, not any authority. 
Our governing principle is “Bahujan hitay, Bahujan sukhay” - when confronted by what decision to make, we should optimise for the benefit of most subscribers, and this will automatically translate to higher optimisation of all other decisions of the entire Learnzy. 


### Token, and current funding needs 

Why do we need to issue tokens now? Why not grant them for contributions ourselves? 
We are kickstarting a concept which will kickstart the concept of doing contributions and relying on it for sustenance. This is a social revolution, which requires that the decision control be with the society itself. The concept of Web3.0 social ownership / Contribute to earn requires a mindset which is very different from traditional capitalist mindsets / short term consumption mindset. We are talking about creating socially-owned assets which will last for many lifetimes, and continue to evolve and become the main occupation of people across the world. 

To ensure that contributors both get incentivised enough to build a critical mass and great environment, we need to show them returns at the outset. Most contributors would not be the people who clearly know Web3 concepts - we would need to give them an easy off-ramp.  

Thus, we need money to: 
-   1. Hire community managers, digital marketers. 
-   2. Spend on marketing and technology costs, hosting. 

1 million FRT tokens will be minted. Upto 25% to be sold off (to meet marketing, hosting and other expenses on an as needed basis) and other expenses, upto 30% will be reserved for team (but granted as per progress. 

We hire for fixed tenures only, not lifetime positions.), 45% will be reserved for community contribution grants. Minting of more tokens will be done after decision is ratified via voting, but as of now it is not expected to happen until our revenue reaches $1million. After this, tokens will be regularly released to match revenues retrospectively, so that the value of tokens is kept steady. 

We intend to be very serious about the FRT token being a store of value, so that our users can rely on it, regardless of inflationary or deflationary economic environments. 



### Future Roadmap 
-  1. Release token to raise funds. Post about Decentralearn at various outlets, so people can know about it. 
-   2. Start working on creating a site like YouTube.com, where everybody is rewarded fairly for contributions - adding videos, views, helpful comments etc. Site should be permissionless to access, and should be very convenient to use. Let this be the product which shows the power of a socially-owned community Decentralearn to the masses.
